## Spring Dawn (春曉)

This famous poem was written by Meng Haoran (孟浩然) during the Tang Dynasty. It's one of the most well-known classical Chinese poems and is often taught to schoolchildren.

The poem captures a peaceful spring morning, with the poet waking up after sleeping through dawn, hearing birdsong everywhere, and wondering about the flowers that may have fallen during the night's wind and rain.

### About the Poet

Meng Haoran (689-740 CE) was a Chinese poet during the Tang Dynasty, known for his nature poetry. He lived as a recluse for much of his life, and his works often reflect his appreciation for natural landscapes and rural life.

### Translation Notes

The final line "花落知多少" (Huā luò zhī duō shǎo) has a particularly elegant ambiguity in Chinese. It can be interpreted as either "How many flowers have fallen?" or "Who knows how many flowers have fallen?" The uncertainty and gentle inquiry reflect the poet's contemplative state and connection with nature.
